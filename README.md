# Sci-Tech Projects
This repository contains a collection of example projects I worked on and presented to students of Temple University's Sci-Tech Scholars program.
As the Adjunct Instructor of CIS 2004: Sci+Tech Scholars Seminar, these projects were created to demonstrate the use of various technologies and concepts in the field of computer science. The goal is to provide students with hands-on experience and practical knowledge that they can apply in their future studies and careers.

## Projects
1. **[json-converter](json-converter)**: An AWS Lambda function that converts JSON files to CSV format. The project demonstrates the use of Cloud Technologies (AWS specifically) with services such as S3 and Lambda, as well as the use of Terraform for infrastructure as code.
2. **[microsatellite](microsatellite)**: A full-stack web application that allows users to upload and analyze microsatellite data. The project demonstrates the use of Flask for the backend, React for the frontend, and PostgreSQL for the database. It also includes the use of Docker for containerization and deployment.
